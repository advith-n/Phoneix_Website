          Phoenix International Academy is a highly progressive and enterprising
          international school in the heritage city Mysuru. Here we emphasize on
          concept-based teaching and learning, as opposed to content and rote
          learning. We focus on processes and outcomes – what a student should
          know and be able to do at any given age – as opposed to emphasizing
          the acquisition of specific knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="phoenix-international-academy">
          Key principles run through the entirety of PIA’s education system such
          as:
        </p>
        <p class="phoenix-international-academy">
          ■ The idea that each student is unique
        </p>
        <p class="phoenix-international-academy">
          ■ An emphasis on developing positive relationships (with teachers,
          parents and peers).
        </p>
        <p class="phoenix-international-academy">
          ■ Focus on enabling environments, with an awareness that learning does
          happen everywhere not just in the classroom.
        </p>
        
        <p class="phoenix-international-academy">
          We emphasize the development of the student as a whole, and
          particularly at the primary level, there is a great deal of scope for
          creativity and individuality in the classroom. Choosing an
          international school like ours not only gives students the benefit of
          a concept based education, but the qualifications gained and knowledge
          acquired are highly transferable. The structure and consistency of the
          national curriculum allows students to easily move, if necessary to
          schools in various countries and within the country. The system also
          facilitates an easy progression to any universities across the globe.
        </p>
        <p class="phoenix-international-academy">
          At Phoenix, we provide a nurturing, stimulating, and student-centred
          learning environment. We want to ensure that students are confident in
          themselves, with others and in their work, and are prepared for
          transitions into new environments. We foster a love of learning that
          will prepare them for the challenges of an ever-changing world.

        What I like best about Phoenix International Academy is the focus on
        each child reaching their full potential. The teachers are approachable
        and there is a real sense of teamwork as the success of each child
        balances between their own efforts, the support of their educators and
        the support provided at home. There is also a very real attempt at
        ensuring the students aren't over-stressed but have a strong application
        based understanding of their subjects to tackle their board exams, etc.
        It takes a village to bring up a child and I am happy that PIA is part
        of my village.
